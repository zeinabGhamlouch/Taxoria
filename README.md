A Taxonomy Enrichment Demo

This repository demonstrates how to enrich a taxonomy using an LLM. The script takes an initial taxonomy (in JSON format) and enriches it by adding new categories and subcategories, leveraging LLM capabilities.

**Try the Live Demo:** [https://taxoria.r2.enst.fr](https://taxoria.r2.enst.fr)

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions below.

### 1. **Clone the repository**

First, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine so that you can run and modify the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeinabGhamlouch/taxoria.git
cd taxoria
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**
Next, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by running the following command. This will install everything listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Run the demo**
Once everything is set up, you can run the demo to enrich the taxonomy. This will use the sample `example_taxonomy.json` file as input and generate an enriched version:

```bash
python -m demo.run_demo
```

After running this command, the enriched taxonomy will be saved to `demo_example/example_taxonomy_enriched.json`.

## 4. Examples
In the `examples` folder, you can find various taxonomies we worked with and enriched using LLMs. Additionally, we've provided interactive **collapsible tree** visualizations of these taxonomies, which you can explore directly by clicking the links below.

### Original Taxonomies:
- **Schema.org**: [View Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/scehma-org@508?cells=chart)
- **eBay**: [View Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/ebay-taxonomy@523?cells=chart)
- **GeoNames**: [View Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/geonames@508?cells=chart)

### Enriched Taxonomies (after LLM processing):

Below are the enriched versions of the three taxonomies. These versions represent the current state of enrichment based on our processing so far:

- **Schema.org** taxonomy:
    - **llama3.2** version: [View Enriched Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/schemaorg_enriched_llama?cells=chart)
  
- **eBay** taxonomy:
    - **llama3.2** version: [View Enriched Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/enriched_ebay_llama@522?cells=chart)
    - **Mistral** version: [View Enriched Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/ebay_enriched_mistral@509?cells=chart)
  
- **Geography** taxonomy:
    - **llama3.2** version: [View Enriched Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/geo_enriched_llama@510?cells=chart)
    - **Mistral** version: [View Enriched Tree](https://observablehq.com/embed/@taxonomies/geo_enriched_mistral@510?cells=chart)

### Notes on the Collapsible Tree Visualizations:

In the enriched collapsible tree visualizations:
- **Gray lines** indicate nodes that come from the original tree.
- **Red lines** represent nodes that were generated by the LLM.
- **Gray dots** represent nodes that can be expanded further.
- **Red dots** represent leaf nodes, which have no further children.

You can interact with these trees to explore the enriched taxonomy structures in a visual and expandable manner.
